The implementation language of the Buildbot web frontend has been changed from CoffeeScript to JavaScript.
The documentation has not been updated yet, as we plan to transition to TypeScript.
In the transitory period support for some browsers, notably IE 11 has been dropped.
We hope to bring support for older browsers back once the transitory period is over.
