displayName: Test result set
description: |
    This resource represents a test result set.
    A test result set consists of a number of related test results.
    These test results need to be related in that they represent the same type of data and are produced by a single step.
    In reasonably tested codebases the number of test results in a test result set will approach several or even tens of thousands.

    There may be a long delay between the creation of the test result set and full creation of the corresponding test results.
    This is tracked by the ``complete`` property.
    If it's ``true``, then the full set of test results have been committed to the database.

    The ``test_result_unparsed_set`` object tracks test result sets that have not been parsed yet.

    tests_passed?:
        description: |
            The number of passed tests in cases when the pass or fail criteria depends only on how
            that single test runs. For example, performance tests that track regressions across
            multiple tests do not have the number of passed tests defined.

        description: |
            The number of failed tests in cases when the pass or fail criteria depends only on how
            that single test runs. For example, performance tests that track regressions across
            multiple tests do not have the number of failed tests defined.

    complete:
        description: |
            ``true`` if all test results associated with test result set have been generated.
